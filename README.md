# Numerical-Analysis

__Note:The report was written in greek__

This is a project done in my 3rd year in the University of Peloponnese
where the goal was to test some methods (ex. Simpon's 1/3 rule) to approximate various functions and some interplotation methods (ex. Least Squares),and comment about there perfomance as well as calculate the corresponding error.
